A Tale of Two Cities
It was the best of times
for good or for evil
in the superlative degree of comparison only
it was the age of foolishness
it was the age of wisdom
it was the epoch of belief
it was the epoch of incredulity
it was the season of Darkness
it was the season of Light
it was the spring of hope
it was the winter of despair
it was the worst of times
that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received
the period was so far like the present period
we had everything before us
we had nothing before us
we were all going direct the other way -in short
we were all going direct to heaven
